# dotfiles README

This repository contains the dotfiles for all the main tools that I use for the development on my
MacBook. It focuses on making the macOS experience to be more keyboard-centric and, therefore
productive/efficient.

However, my setup also tries to be minimal and not require additional macOS security configuration
shenanigans.

You're more than welcome to try my configuration for yourself.

## Setup

If you're interested in checking out my setup, all you need to do is to:

1. Have ssh set up on your machine for GitHub communication.
2. Backup your own dotfiles.
3. Run the [.install.sh](./.install.sh) script.

The installation of tools and setup process is automated, you'll only have to react to terminal
prompts.

## Other Cool Tools Worth Considering
